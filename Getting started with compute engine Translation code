# Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting started with compute engine.

#Objectives:
Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.

#Tasks:
1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

3.Connect between the two instances.

Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network.

Connect to my-vm-2 using ssh
   gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
   run ping to test connection to my-vm-1
     ping my-vm-1

Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1
 ssh my-vm-1
  install the Nginx web server
    sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
 sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
 Hi from YOUR_NAME

Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
 
 curl http://localhost/

To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command.
 exit

To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
 
 curl http://my-vm-1/

Get external IP for my-vm-1
 
 gcloud compute instances list

  copy and paste my-vm-1 external IP to a web browser address bar
you will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
